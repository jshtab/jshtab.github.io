# Contact Me

Send mail to: {{< protect "tabb a" "il com " "t g" "jsh" "ma" >}}

There is **an extra B on the end**.
The email is protected using magic of my own design. If you can't see the email address, you need to use a browser like Chrome or Firefox.
Alternatively, my e-mail is available on [GitHub].
