# Contact Me

- If it's anything related to recruitment or employment, please message via [LinkedIn].
- Do **not send me email** about bugs or feature requests. Submit tickets/issues/reports directly. See the [list of projects](/projects).

For anything else, email is the way to go. Send mail to: {{< protect "jshtabb at gmail com" >}}

The extra 'b' at the end is intentional. Yes, you can't select it. It is to stop robots.
