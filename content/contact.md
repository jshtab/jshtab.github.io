# Contact Me

- If it's anything related to recruitment or employment, please message via [LinkedIn].
- Do **not send me email** about bugs or feature requests. Submit tickets/issues/reports directly. See the [list of projects](/project).

For anything else, email is the way to go. Send mail to: {{< protect "tabb a" "il com " "t g" "jsh" "ma" >}}

The extra 'b' at the end is intentional. If you can't see the email address, either switch to a recent graphical web browser, or just get my email address from [GitHub].
