Welcome to my bin of questions, half-baked ideas, and interesting things that show up while I'm tinkering with software, websites, or whatever.
Feel free to [contact me](./contact) about anything on here, and check out some of my [recent projects](./project) while you're at it.

Anything that I couldn't find in a few seconds online end up here once I solve them. These are some recent / important guides, you can find the rest [here](./guide/).
