I'm a passionate software developer with mostly practical experience in full-stack web development, navigating ancient piles of spaghetti, and building quick-'n-dirty automation when needed. I also contribute to open-source video games and administer Linux<sup>&reg;</sup> systems for fun.

I am looking for work in the Fredericksburg/Stafford area. My resum&eacute; and references are available by [e-mail](/contact).

This page is a work-in-progress as of May 2025.
