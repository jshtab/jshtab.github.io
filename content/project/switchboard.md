# Switchboard Lab

An experiment with angular, currently on hiatus. The idea was to make an application that can build itself from external configuration at runtime. More on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshtab/switchboard-lab) or the [Demo](https://jshtab.github.io/switchboard-lab).


**Edit**: As of Angular 16's release, all of the work done towards this project is basically pointless, because of the addition of Signals into Angular. But, it should make continuing the project easier, since Signals are so much better than whatever RxJS magic I hacked together.
